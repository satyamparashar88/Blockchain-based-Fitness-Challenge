# Blockchain Fitness Challenge

## Description

The Blockchain Fitness Challenge is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that gamifies fitness goals through financial incentives. Users can stake APT tokens on their fitness commitments and earn rewards for successfully completing their challenges.

The platform operates on a simple yet effective mechanism: participants join fitness challenges by staking tokens and setting personal step targets with time-bound deadlines. Upon successful completion of their goals, participants receive their original stake back plus a 50% bonus reward, creating a powerful motivation system that combines financial incentives with health and wellness objectives.

Key features include:
- **Stake-based Challenges**: Users commit APT tokens to their fitness goals
- **Time-bound Goals**: Each challenge has a specific deadline to create urgency
- **Reward System**: Successful completion yields 150% of the original stake
- **Transparent Tracking**: All challenge data is stored immutably on the blockchain
- **Self-executing**: Smart contract automatically handles rewards and stake management

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize personal fitness and wellness by leveraging blockchain technology to create a trustless, transparent, and incentivized ecosystem for health improvement. We aim to:

- **Democratize Fitness Motivation**: Make financial incentives accessible to anyone wanting to improve their health
- **Build Healthy Communities**: Create a global network of individuals committed to fitness through shared financial stakes
- **Eliminate Trust Issues**: Remove the need for centralized fitness platforms by using smart contracts for automatic reward distribution
